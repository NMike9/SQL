-- In this repository entry I want to see if spending more money on total team salary leads to winning and success. 

-- It is a large dataset so I am going to start out searching when salary spending reflected modern day salary spending
-- I will run a query to see how far back the stats and baseball data go. 

-- The following query shows us that the first year of stats in this database starts in 1871 in the NA league
-- A league that is no longer active 

SELECT MIN(yearid), lgid
FROM teams
GROUP BY lgid

-- The next query will show us which leagues are active 

SELECT * 
FROM leagues 
WHERE active = 'Y'

-- Lets find out what is considered the first year of the AL, ML, and NL in this dataset 

SELECT MIN(yearid)
FROM teams as t
JOIN leagues as l
ON t.lgid = l.lgid
WHERE l.lgid IN ('AL', 'NL', 'ML') AND l.active = 'Y'

-- It looks like that was not effective as the first year of the National league goes back to 1876
-- I will search the first time the AL and NL merged to make Major League baseball 

SELECT MIN(yearid)
FROM teams as t
LEFT JOIN leagues as l
ON t.lgid = l.lgid
WHERE l.lgid = 'ML'

-- I decided to try it a different way because the Major league "ML" exists in the database to only show that it is 
--one of the active leagues. It lists players as either in the AL or NL, one of the conferences
-- I will go decade by decade to see how many teams existed in the league during each year to define my salary spending and its effectiveness

SELECT lgid, teamid, franchid
FROM teams 
WHERE yearid = 1950

-- In 1950 Major League baseball, only 16 teams existed. This next query I will just count how many teams were in the league the
-- rest of the century

SELECT COUNT(franchid), yearid
FROM teams 
WHERE yearid BETWEEN 1960 AND 2000
GROUP BY yearid 
ORDER BY yearid ASC

-- This was a very effective query as it shows the Major league transformation from 16 teams to 18 teams in 1961, then in 1962
-- the league expanded to 20 teams for the next 6 years... then in 1969 Major League Baseball jumped up to 24 teams. Then in 
-- 1977 it jumped up to 26 teams all the way until 1993 two more teams were added. Then in 1998 2 more teams were added to reflect
-- 30 teams like today. 

-- Now lets look at salary spending 

SELECT SUM(salary) as total_team_salary, teamid, yearid
FROM salaries 
WHERE yearid BETWEEN 1985 AND 2019
GROUP BY teamid, yearid
ORDER BY SUM(salary) DESC
LIMIT 100

-- The previous query showed us that the New York Yankees and the LA Dodgers are the biggest spenders, with the NY Yankees occupying
-- 6 of the top ten most expensive total salaries and the Dodgers occupying the other 4 slots in the top then. The next query will show 
-- how many times out of the top 100 the NY yankees spent top dollars on their team in total salary by season from 1985 and on

SELECT teamid, yearid FROM (

GROUP BY highest_salary.teamid, highest_salary.yearid
ORDER BY highest_salary.yearid ASC

-- The New York Yankees actually only appeared in the top 100 15 times. I thought it would be more. Lets count how many 
-- times each team appeared in that top 100 list. 
-- This was all good practice, but I just noticed the database didn't start sharing salary prices in this dataset until 1985. 
-- That narrows our scope by 16 seasons. I went back and changed all queries to start research from 1985 and on. 

SELECT COUNT(teamid), teamid FROM (

		LIMIT 100) as HS
GROUP BY HS.teamid 
ORDER BY COUNT(HS.teamid) DESC;

-- The top 9 teams from the previous query had 5 or more teams in the top 75 of most expensive teams. New York Yankees
-- had 15 of the most expensive teams and Boston Red Sox were next with 13, then Detroit with 8 and the Angels tied at 8. 
-- Also going back a few queries, all of the top 100 most expensive teams in salaries were from 2010 and on through 2017. 

-- I think the better way of figuring this out is to base things off of averages and window functions to see
-- more data displayed at once

			(SELECT SUM(s.salary) as total_salary_py, s.yearid, t.franchid

-- 8 Teams won when spending over 100 million but under 200 million. So that makes it that only one more team won the World series

-- The next query will rank salary spending from 1 to 26/28/30 depending on the season and from highest to lowest. Then we will

WHERE SR.w >= 90

-- 149 of the 214 teams that finished with 90 or more wins since 1985 were in the top half of salary spending, whereas 65 were 
-- in the lower half of spending

-- To sum up the data, the NY Yankees and Boston Red Sox are great examples of spending leading to winning. The Yankees
-- have had the most expensive team 15 seasons and the Red Sox are next with 13. They are also 1st and 2nd in highest average
-- salary. It "paid off" because they are first and second in Total wins, Average wins and World series wins since 1985. 
-- The Yankees have 3,172 total wins, Average 90.6 wins per season, and have 5 World Series wins in that span. 
-- The Red Sox have 3,032 total wins, Average 86.6 wins per season, and have 4 World Series wins in the same span. 

-- Of those 9 World Series Wins between them, the years they won they ranked 2nd, 2nd, 1st, 1st, 2nd, 2nd, 1st, 4th (for some reason
-- the database doesn't show any results after 2016 in some queries) in highest salary spending

-- There are a few teams that show that you don't need to spend a ton to suceed. Those teams are the Cincinatti Reds,
-- Oakland A's, Minnesota Twins, and the Kansas City Royals. 

-- The Minnesota Twins won 2 World Series in 1987 and 1991. Those years they were the 24th highest spending team and the 12th. 
-- The Minnestoa Twins are also in the bottom half of average salary spending. Unfortunately, they are 19th in total wins and 
-- average wins per season with 2750 total wins and 78.5 wins from 1985 to 2019. They are 23rd in Average salary spending though. 

-- The Oakland A's won 1 World Series from our assesment period in 1989. Although they were 8th highest in salary spending that
-- season, they are 28th in average salary spending over our assesment period. They also have had the highest winning team in 4 
-- of those seasons. That is second to the Yankees, Braves, and Cardinals 5. 6 times they had 90 win seasons where they were in 
-- the bottom half of the 20s in highest total team salary. 2 of those 6 seasons they won over 100 games in a season. All of those 
-- seasons were post 2001. As the movie Money Ball suggests, "Money Ball" leads to regular season success, but has yet to win them 
-- a World Series. 

-- Kansas City Royals and the Cincinatti Reds are two other good examples that paying doesn't lead to winning. Both are in the 
-- bottom half of salary spending average and both are World Series Champs in our assesment span from 1985 to 2019. Both times 
-- the Royals won the WS in 1985 and 2015, they were ranked 17th in salary spending. The year Cincinatti won in 1990 
-- they were 21st in salary spending. 
-- Their regular season success hasn't been as great. Cincinatti is 17th overall in total wins with 2756, and an average of 78.7 
-- per season. Although Kansas city has won 2 World Series in this span, they are 29th in total wins with 2581 which is 73.7
-- wins per season. 

-- Overall I don't think there is direct correlation to Spending = Winning. The Yankees and Red Sox, along with other big market
-- teams have found success and also have spent a lot of money on total team salary, but there are plenty of other teams that have 
-- succeeded in both the regular season or by winning World Series Championships without having to spend a lot in total team salary. 
-- I would say that although there is some strong evidence with the Yankees and Red Sox, it isn't obvious enough to say that winning
-- is due to high salary spending. Compared to other professional leagues, there is clearly more parity in Major League Baseball

-- (The results are skewed in some of these queries because the salaries only go as far as 2016, but the World Series results go 
-- all the way to 2019). Out of 33 years (1994 lockout there was no champion), there have been 20 different WS champs. 

-- In the NBA there has been 12 different winners in the same span and they didn't have a lockout season with no champion. 
-- The NFL in a similar time span has had 16 different franchises win the Super Bowl. 

-- The MLB has had 20 as mentioned before. There are multiple factors to the parity in this sport. It is a team game where one 
-- player can't have as big of an impact like in the NBA or NFL. And although the Yankees and Red Sox spent the most and won 
-- the most, there were plenty seasons where teams spend a lot and didn't win. 12 times a team spent over 200 million in a season.
-- Only one time one of those teams won the World Series. 

-- After the year 2000 the World series winning team won 7 times spending under 100 million dollars, 8 times spending over 100
-- million, and 1 time spending over 200 million (the yankees as mentioned before) 

-- The most important query was this one copied and pasted below

-- 133 teams spent over 100 million, but under 200 million on total salary. 125 of them didn't win the WS. The SUM salaries of
-- those teams that didn't win the WS is 16.08 Billion. If you divide that by 125, it is 128,640,000
-- (I initially did SUM for the query above, but then changed it to AVG and the final number was very similar)


-- You have to wonder if the risk/reward is worth it for spending more money. 4 times the LA Dodgers spent over 200 million per
-- season and didn't win the WS. From 1985 to 2019 they won it once. (This database doesn't cover 2020 when LAD won the WS again) 

-- And although the New York Yankees won 5 times from 1985 to 2016 when we have salary totals. They spent over 200 million 8 times
-- and only won it one of those times. The other 4 times the Yankees won the WS from 1996 to 2000 they spent under 100 million all 
-- four times. The big spending didn't start until after the year 2000, but it goes to show that spending 
-- doesn't equal winning. 

-- Boston won 4 WS titles after the spending increased in 2001. They supposedly combined "Money Ball" tactics along with spending
-- and as a result they won 4 WS titles from 2004 to 2018. Never spending over 200 million.
