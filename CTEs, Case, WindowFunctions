***Saw a TikTok saying that after the Disney Movie 'Splash' came out in 1985 the name 'Madison' went from predominantly a Boy name to a Girl Name because the 
main actress' character plays a mermaid turned human who names herself 'Madison.' Lets see if that is true
SELECT year,
  SUM(CASE WHEN gender = 'M' THEN number ELSE 0 END) as Male_Madison,
  SUM(CASE WHEN gender = 'F' THEN number ELSE 0 END) as Female_Madison
FROM `bigquery-public-data.usa_names.usa_1910_current`
WHERE name = 'Madison'
GROUP BY year
ORDER BY year 
-- Result - Most Definitely True. From 1910 - 1983 the Female_Madison column has only 0 for every year until in 1984 there were 6 girls named Madison. Let's use 
this as a CTE to count the number of times the name Madison was given after 1984

WITH MFMadison AS(
  SELECT year,
  SUM(CASE WHEN gender = 'M' THEN number ELSE 0 END) as Male_Madison,
  SUM(CASE WHEN gender = 'F' THEN number ELSE 0 END) as Female_Madison
FROM `bigquery-public-data.usa_names.usa_1910_current`
WHERE name = 'Madison'
GROUP BY year
ORDER BY year 
)
SELECT SUM(Female_Madison) AS nGiven
FROM MFMadison
WHERE year >= 1985
-- Result - Wow! The TikTok was accurate. After the movie 'Splash,' Madison went from 6 to 399,095 times given to girls. It is now predominantly a girl name now.
